## :information_source: Prerequisites (important)

As per the [Provider Node Documentation > Prerequisites](https://handbook.golem.network/provider-tutorials/provider-tutorial#prerequisites):

> To run Golem Sneak Peek you'll need a physical machine as you may encounter issues when running it on a virtual machine.

Your Docker host must be a physical machine: you will need to give the container access to the `/dev/kvm` device.

Furthermore, Golem only supports 64-bit architecture for the moment (see [GolemFactory/Yagna Releases Page](https://github.com/golemfactory/yagna/releases)).

## :arrow_forward: Usage

You can clone this repository or use the provided `docker-compose.yml` as a base template for your own setup.

A `Makefile` is included for convenience but `make` is not required to run the node.

Use `make` or `make help` to list the available shortcuts.

### 1. First Start

Use `make setup` to run the node for the first time.

The CLI will ask you a few questions: refer to the [Provider Node Documentation > Initial Setup](https://handbook.golem.network/provider-tutorials/provider-tutorial#initial-setup) for more details.

The node settings will be kept on your host in a `./data-node` repository.

### 2. Run the Node

Use `make up` to start the node in a detached mode.

You can access the logs at any time by running `make logs`.

Use `make status` to get your node address and health.
